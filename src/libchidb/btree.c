/*
 *  chidb - a didactic relational database management system
 *
 * This module contains functions to manipulate a B-Tree file. In this context,
 * "BTree" refers not to a single B-Tree but to a "file of B-Trees" ("chidb
 * file" and "file of B-Trees" are essentially equivalent terms).
 *
 * However, this module does *not* read or write to the database file directly.
 * All read/write operations must be done through the pager module.

/* Open a B-Tree file
 *
 * This function opens a database file and verifies that the file
 * header is correct. If the file is empty (which will happen
 * if the pager is given a filename for a file that does not exist)
 * then this function will (1) initialize the file header using
 * the default page size and (2) create an empty table leaf node
 * in page 1.
 *
 * Parameters
 * - filename: Database file (might not exist)
 * - db: A chidb struct. Its bt field must be set to the newly
 *       created BTree.
 * - bt: An out parameter. Used to return a pointer to the
 *       newly created BTree.
 *
 * Return
 * - CHIDB_OK: Operation successful
 * - CHIDB_ECORRUPTHEADER: Database file contains an invalid header

 * calls itself recursively on that child node. However, before doing so
 * it will check if the child node is full or not. If it is, then it will
 * have to be split first.
